#config_auto_drive
New config for LMS 2.0

#Requirements
 * cmake,make,compiler(gcc 4.8 for example)
 * [conan](https://conan.io/) (install python, call pip install conan)


#Getting started
Easy setup.
```
mkdir build
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing
```
Done :)

Now you just need to call the start script (doesn't work atm as LMS 2.0 is not finished yet, but you can already build it)
